Description: A code that will calcuate LXW, Area of the circle, Volume, Surface Area
based on user input
VARIABLE DICTIONARY:
Length1: Based on user input defines the length for the equation LXW
Width1: Based on user input defines the width for LXW
Area: Based on user input the area is defined
Radius1: Based on user input defines the radius for the equation needed for the area of the circle
Area2: Gives the area of the circle based on user input
Radius2: Based on user input defines the radius needed for volume and surface area
Height1: Based on user input defines the height needed for volume and surface area
Volume1:  Gives the volume  of a based on user input
SurfaceArea: Gives the SA based on user input
Length2: Based on user input defines the length needed for the pendulum
Gravity: The gravity needed for the equation of the pendulum that the user does not need to input"""



import math
# Prints the following statement
print("The first question")
#Ask the user to specify the length
Length1 = input("please input length: ")
#Converts the length to the integer data type
Length1 = int(Length1)
#Asks the user to specify the length
Width1 = input("please input width: ")
#Converts the width to the integer data type
Width1 = int(Width1)
#Multiplies length times width for the area
Area = int(Length1*Width1)
#Prints the area
print("The area is", Area)

#Prints the following statement
print("The second question")
#Asks the user to input the radius
Radius1 = input("please input radius: ")
#Converts the variable value to the integer data type
Radius1 = int(Radius1)
#Calculates the area using the equation
Area2 = math.pi*math.pow(Radius1,2)
#Prints the area to the second decimal
print("The area of the circle is %.2f" % Area2)

#Prints the following statement
print("The third question")
#Asks the user to input the radius
Radius2 = input("please input radius: ")
#Converts the variable value to the integer data type
Radius2 = int(Radius2)
#Asks the user to input the height
Height1 = input("please input height: ")
#Converts the variable value into the integer data type
Height1 = int(Height1)
#Calculates the volume using the proper equation
Volume1 = math.pi*math.pow(Radius2,2)*Height1
#Calculates the surface area using the proper equation
SurfaceArea = 2*math.pi*Radius2*Height1 + 2*math.pi*math.pow(Radius2,2)
#Prints the volume to the 2nd decimal
print("The volume is %.2f" % Volume1)
#Prints the SA to the 2nd decimal
print("The surface area is %.2f" % SurfaceArea)

#Prints the following statement
print("The fourth question")
#Asks the user to input the length
Length2 = input("please input length: ")
#Converts the variable value to the integer data type
Length2 = int(Length2)
#Gravity value is specifed to 8 and is made to the float data type
Gravity:float = float(9.8)
#Calculates the pendulum
Pendulum = 2*math.pi*(math.sqrt(Length2/Gravity))
#Prints the pendulum to the 2nd decimal
print("The pendulum is %.2f" % Pendulum)
